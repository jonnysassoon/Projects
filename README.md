# Projects
This a collection of some of the notable work I have done both in and out of school.

For the DataStructuresAndAlgorithms directory, some of the data structures
are built with non-trivial methods that would otherwise have been put in the
algorithms directory corresponding to that data type. Scroll through
the implementation to see some of these methods.

# Requirements
Python files require an interpreter >= Python 3
C++ files require a compiler >= c++11
