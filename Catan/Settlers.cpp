NOTICE: moveKnight() will assume that not being able to move a knight to a new location is a possibility (thereby deleting the knight). This component of the code will have to check that the first person (the player who deactivated his knight) has the possibility of relocating his knight. Otherwise, if he doesn't and the function is called anyway, the function will determine that he does not have a new place to put his knight and will thus delete it instead of just reporting that the action was invalid to begin with.
